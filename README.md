# Rational Exuberance: The Psychology Behind the Dot-Com Bubble  
*A data-driven analysis of rational expectations and behavioural biases (1995–2001)*

---

## 🧭 Introduction and context
This research investigates whether the late-1990s dot-com bubble can be considered a *rational* or *irrational* episode in financial history.  
It combines theoretical perspectives from the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and behavioural finance with empirical evidence from the NASDAQ, S&P 500, and leading technology firms between 1995 and 2001.

## 📊 Key discoveries
- **NASDAQ +571 %** vs **S&P 500 +167 %** from 1995 to 2000.  
- **Volatility ≈ 45 %** for NASDAQ annual returns (5× S&P 500).  
- **Maximum drawdown ≈ −78 %** between 2000 and 2002.  
- **GDP growth ≈ 3.9 %** / **CPI ≈ 2.5 %** → weak macro correlation.  
- **Fundamentals:**  
  - Cisco traded above 120× earnings.  
  - Amazon’s P/S ≈ 48× with negative EPS.  
- **Interpretation:** genuine technological optimism evolved into speculative mania—*rational in origin, irrational in scale.*

## 📈 Data & Methodology
| **NASDAQ & S&P 500 Index Levels (1995–2000)** | Yahoo Finance | Prices, annual returns, volatility, drawdowns | Normalized to 1995 = 100 |

| **Macro Indicators** | FRED Database | GDP Growth, CPI Inflation | Annual averages 1995–2000 |

| **Company Fundamentals** | Macrotrends / FactSet | Price, EPS, Revenue, Profitability | Cisco, Amazon, Intel, Oracle, Microsoft |

| **Failed Firms Dataset** | News Archives | Listing & Bankruptcy Dates | Pets.com, Webvan, eToys |

### Metrics Used
- **Return** = (P_t / P_{t−1}) − 1  
- **Volatility** = STDEV(Returns)  
- **Drawdown** = (P_t / Max(P_{1..t})) − 1  
- **P/E** = Price / Earnings per Share  
- **P/S** = Price / Revenue per Share  

All calculations were performed in Excel (see attached file).

## 💡 Interpretation & Modern Parallels
The bubble originated from rational expectations of a digital revolution, reinforced by rapid productivity growth and low interest rates.  
However, behavioural forces—herding, narrative bias, and overconfidence—amplified valuations beyond fundamentals.  
Similar patterns can be observed in modern episodes such as the **cryptocurrency boom (2021)** and **AI-equities rally (2023)**, suggesting that innovation cycles consistently blend rational and irrational dynamics.
